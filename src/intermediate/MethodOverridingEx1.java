/*
 * Method overriding or Runtime polymorphism
 * 
 * If both the parent class and child class has the same method signature, then that method is called as a Overridden method
 * 
 * method overriding is used to give a different implemenetation in the child class
 * It comes with parent child relationship. method overriding will happen in the child class
 * 
 * Same method signature--> no difference in the no. of arguments and no difference in the datatype of the arguments
